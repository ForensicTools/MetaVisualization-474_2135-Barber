This tool will take a collection of images, extract metadata, and analyze against data from other images metadata to reveal patterns. Results will be displayed in a graphical form. The front-end will be developed in php with MySQL and the back-end will be written in Python. Other tools such as JHead, ExifTool, and exif-py may be used for metadata extraction.
